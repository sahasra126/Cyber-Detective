↑ Show less SOC/IR teams will struggle to find and maintain CTI for cloud threats. Issues concerning computer telephony integration (CTI) for cloud are quite different from traditional threats. Much like how traditional security does not work for cloud, traditional CTI also does not apply directly. In the coming years, there will be an increased demand for CTI for cloud. This will require a lot of innovation from security vendors, incident response teams and standards organizations — even CTI tools will need to evolve. Cloud services are being abused in creative ways. For example, Cobalt Strike configurations taken from JPCERT using Azure function apps, infostealers abusing GitHub Codespaces URLs for data exfiltration, and the 3CX ransomware using GitHub to fetch C2 information. SOC and IR teams could miss on the unknown. Traditional solutions based on IP reputation, for example, wouldn't flag them malicious outright unless they are known. Why is Cloud API visibility required from a CTI perspective? Unless cloud providers are clear and public with the APIs they provide, it is almost impossible for the end user to be aware of what's happening in their environment. For instance, AWS has had cloud vulnerabilities arising from undocumented public APIs that threat actors could have exploited, allowing cases of complete elastic container registry (ECR) compromise to cross-account access.

↑ Show less Attacks spanning on-premise to cloud or across clouds will go undetected for longer than on-premise attacks. Hybrid and multi-cloud environments are becoming more common. This growth also leads to a big cybersecurity challenge: detecting attacks that go from on-premises systems to the cloud, or across different clouds, is harder and takes longer. These environments mix on-premises systems with cloud services, making security more complicated. One main problem is that different parts of these systems often have their own security policies and ways of monitoring, usually by different teams. This can create blind spots, where it's hard to detect, correlate, and respond to unusual or harmful activities, especially when attackers move within the network. It's tougher to spot them in these mixed environments compared to a single on-premises network. In hybrid and multi-cloud systems, attackers can stay hidden for longer (called a “higher dwell time”), moving around and accessing important data or systems. Traditional security approaches, like guarding the network edge, won't work as well because it's not clear where the edge is anymore. To handle these challenges, analysts need to adapt a more cohesive approach to security. This means using the same security tools and rules across both on-premises and cloud parts. Managed detection and response (MDR) services can help a lot here, giving a single view and automated response across different environments. It's also important to not automatically trust any request for access, no matter where it comes from. This is called the Zero Trust model. It means checking every access request carefully, whether it's from inside the company or from a cloud service. As more companies use hybrid and multi-cloud setups in 2024, these security challenges will grow. We need to change our security strategies to be more integrated, automated, and cautious to stay safe against these advanced threats.

↑ Show less Edge computing backed by cloud technologies will become a new ‘entry-point’ for attacks into the cloud. By 2024, edge computing, which often uses cloud technologies in the back end, will become a crucial point for cyberattacks. This change is driven by the increasing adoption on cloud-native solutions across various devices and systems. These edge devices, being in the frontline of data collection and processing, represent new challenges for security. Currently, edge device attacks focus on exploiting the device’s resources, like infecting an IoT device and making it part of a botnet. However, as these devices increasingly connect to and depends on cloud services, they become gateways to broader network intrusions. This shift in focus from stealing the edge devices resources to their role as access points to larger networks marks a significant evolution in the cloud security landscape. The edge compute attack exposure to the cloud is partially due to the incomplete or lack of implementation of the Zero Trust model in cloud services. Zero Trust is about never automatically trusting any user or device within or outside the network, but instead, requiring verification at every step. When this model is not fully implemented, it creates security loopholes. Attackers can exploit these gaps, using the edge devices as entry points to infiltrate cloud and hybrid cloud networks. This risk grows with the diversity and often less secure nature of edge devices, which range from vehicles, IoT devices, PoS outlets, and others.
