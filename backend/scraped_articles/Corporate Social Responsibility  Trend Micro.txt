With cybercrime gaining ground in recent years, security vendors and law enforcement agencies have been working hard to secure the internet from malicious threats. We want to make sure we do our part by sharing resources and working on investigation strategies and community awareness with organisations in the private and public sectors, including the FBI, INTERPOL, various nonprofit organisations, and leading security vendors.

These partnerships have led to numerous key victories that have, in turn, strengthened our desire to see a world in which the internet is safe for everyone.
