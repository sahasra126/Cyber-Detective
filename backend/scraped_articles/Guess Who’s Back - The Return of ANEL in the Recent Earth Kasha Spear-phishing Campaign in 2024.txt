This blog is a part of a blog series about Earth Kasha. Kindly refer to our blog about the previous campaigns, where we discussed the tactics and targets of Earth Kasha in detail, read here for a deeper understanding,

Introduction

According to research by Trend Micro, a new spear-phishing campaign targeting individuals and organisations in Japan has been underway since around June 2024. An interesting aspect of this campaign is the comeback of a backdoor dubbed ANEL, which was used in campaigns targeting Japan by APT10 until around 2018 and had not been observed since then. Additionally, NOOPDOOR, known to be used by Earth Kasha, has been confirmed to be used in the same campaign. Based on these findings, we assess this campaign as part of a new operation by Earth Kasha.

Campaign Details

The campaign, observed around June 2024 and attributed to Earth Kasha, employed spear-phishing emails for Initial Access. Specific targets include individuals affiliated with political organisations, research institutions, think tanks, and organisations related to international relations. In 2023, Earth Kasha primarily attempted to exploit vulnerabilities against edge devices for intrusion but this new campaign reveals that they have once again changed their TTPs. This shift appears to be driven by a target change, moving from enterprises to individuals. Additionally, an analysis of the victim profiles and the names of the distributed lure files suggests that the adversaries are particularly interested in topics related to Japan’s national security and international relations.
