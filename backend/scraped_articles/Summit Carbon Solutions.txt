Summit Carbon Solutions’ growth has been remarkably dynamic. Although the company is already a leader, there’s plenty of room for expansion. “I know that as the company grows, as I add the next thing—such as containerised security options applications—Trend Micro is going to be there for me,” says Cradit.

Through years of fruitful collaboration, Cradit has taken on his latest challenges knowing that Trend is a partner. “That feeling of togetherness and how we build and deploy according to need—it’s like we’re in this together. It’s a true partnership.”
